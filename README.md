## Fundamentals of Web Development

**The Web Fundamentals workshop consists of three important phases.**

- #### The On Boarding or "getting the tooling setup".

- #### A Sprint to the CRUD or "let's build regular web software".

- #### The Creative Sandbox or "let's build fancier web software".

## PHASE 1 - The On Boarding

The On Boarding phase will ensure your technical environment functions appropriately. It will build your understanding of our code feedback cycle and it will begin your introduction to the concepts and tools that define web development.  A solid foundation and clear understanding of CodeUnion during the On Boarding phase will help you acclimate to our system of building technical skills.


On Boarding involves a decent amount of 'grunt work'.  The work might seem chunky, unclear and overly complicated.  It is unclear, chunky and overly complicated.  We will help you with everything.  Your job is to dive into the pool without hesitation and ask us everytime you encounter a step, task, turn, juke or jive that you can't deal with or don't understand.  Our job is to make sure you are supported and that you can finish the onboarding phase in a timely fashion.

### On Boarding Tasks
##### please complete in order

1. Read and digest [asking for help][asking-for-help].
  - Make sure you ask for help or support whenever you feel stuck.
1. Read and digest [working with the development environment][development-environment].
  - Ensure you have ruby 2.0 or higher, a code editor like sublime and git functioning.
1. Read and digest [git basics][git-basics].
  - Fork and clone the [web fundamentals repo][web-fundamentals-repo].
  - Visit your own github profile, upload a nice pic and add a public email address.
  - https://github.com/settings/profile
1. Fork, clone and run the [dot env tutorial][dot-env]
  - Understand how to correctly store 'environmental keys'.
1. Fork, clone and run the [request for feedback][request-for-feedback] repository.
  - Read this repository's readme carefully, ensure that you can submit requests for feedback.
1. Fork, clone and begin working on [week-1 katas][katas]
  - Use your copy of the request for feedback command line app to submit your first request for code feedback.

You have successfully on boarded when you complete the above tasks and begin making requests for feedback on week1 katas.  Completing the On Boarding phase by the first day of your workshop will really help maximize your coding momentum.  That being said, you should aim to complete your on boarding process as soon as you can but for certain, no later than the end of the first week of your Web Fundamentals Workshop.
