# Communications

Good communication is always important, and especially for remote learning. At CodeUnion, we try to make communication as fluid, clear, and accessible as possible.

There are five platforms for communication at CodeUnion:

1. [Slack](#slack) - central hub, with workshop-specific channels
1. [GitHub](#github) - discussions and feedback about specific code
1. [Live Sessions](#live-sessions) - live seminars with instructor and students
1. [Email](#email) - general broadcasts of information, sensitive information
1. [Facebook](#facebook) - because everyone loves a FB group

**Let us help you.**

If you are working on code and you have any problems, stuck on something, it won't run, something in your development environment breaks, your cat eats your hard drive, the files for some reason aren't in the computer, etc.

Anytime, any place, we will try to make it work. Part of the CodeUnion process requires remote communication. We will always go the distance to help you get your situation resolved. Make sure to review and understand the ways that you can communicate with us.

## Slack

The [CodeUnion Slack community][slack-cu] is our **primary communication platform**. All communications about the Web Fundamentals workshop can be found in the [#web-fundamentals][slack-web-fun-channel] channel.

All students (past and present) are on Slack. It's a great place to ask for help, share ideas, or post something interesting.

If you're new to Slack, take a gander at the [Slack Basics][slack-basics-help] help articles.

A few important / useful tips: you can @-mention anyone in a Slack channel and it will send them a notification. For example, to message Jesse, you would write `@jfarmer` in your post.

You can also send a notification to everyone on the channel by including `@channel` in your post.

Please email outreach@codeunion.io if you haven't received your slack invite or would like another.

## GitHub

Lots of communication happens in discussions on GitHub. Because GitHub lets you comment on just about anything, it is a great place to keep conversations about code very close to the code itself.

You will receive feedback as comments on your commits and pull requests.

You can even send notifications in comments by @-mentioning other GitHub users. This will send them a notification. You can see your own notifications at [https://github.com/notifications](https://github.com/notifications).

If you have time, learn more about the awesome powers of [writing on GitHub][writing-gh-help].

## Live Sessions

Live sessions are hosted by instructors. You will receive invites to the sessions with information about how to get access to them.

Usually our sessions will be on [Zoom][zoom], a video conferencing software. You'll need to install it in order to join the live sessions.

## Email

You can always send emails to your instructors or to the Web Fundamentals mailing list. But, usually, Slack is a better option. :D

If you're really stuck on something, and Slack isn't giving you any answers, you can always email stuck@codeunion.io. Easy to remember, right?

Please email outreach@codeunion.io if you have any email-related questions.

## Facebook

CodeUnion has a Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/codeunion. Students past and present are welcome to join.
