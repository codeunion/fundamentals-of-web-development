# Communications

**Let us help you.**

If you are working on code and you have any problems, stuck on something, it won't run, something in your development environment breaks, your cat eats your hard drive, the files for some reason aren't in the computer, etc.

Anytime, any place, we will try to make it work. Part of the CodeUnion process requires remote communication. We will always go the distance to help you get your situation resolved. Make sure to review and understand the ways that you can communicate with us.

## Slack

The [CodeUnion Slack community][slack-cu] is our **primary communication platform**. All communications about the Web Fundamentals workshop can be found in the [#web-fundamentals][slack-web-fun-channel] channel.

All students (past and present) are on Slack. It's a great place to ask for help, share ideas, or post something interesting.

If you're new to Slack, take a gander at the [Slack Basics][slack-basics-help] help articles.

A few important / useful tips: you can @-message anyone in a Slack channel and it will send them a notification. For example, to message Jesse, you would write `@jfarmer` in your post.

You can also send a notification to everyone on the channel by including `@group` in your post.

Please email outreach@codeunion.io if you haven't received your slack invite or would like another.

## Email

You can always send emails to your instructors or to the Web Fundamentals mailing list. But, usually, Slack is a better option. :D

If you're really stuck on something, and Slack isn't giving you any answers, you can always email stuck@codeunion.io. Easy to remember, right?

Please email outreach@codeunion.io if you have any email-related questions.

## Facebook

CodeUnion has a Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/codeunion. Students past and present are welcome to join.
