# Syllabus: Fundamentals of Web Development

Each sprint, think about picking one of the example projects and working on it to feature completion.

Throughout the entire workshop, attemp to complete as many kata as possible.  Remember to request feedback code as frequently as possible.  Make small frequent commits and ask for regular feedback.  If someone hasn't responded to your code within 24 hours, make a specific inquiry.

## Sprint 1 - Programming Fundamentals

Students will get their hands dirty writing Ruby applications that interact with files, websites, and third-party APIs.  Most projects will involve printing out "interesting information" in multiple formats, e.g., text, HTML, CSV, and/or JSON.

The high-level goal is to get students comfortable with the idea of fetching raw data, processing it, and outputting it in a new format.  We want students asking questions like:

- Where does the data I want live?
- How do I get that data?
- How is that data encoded?
- How do I decode and process that data in Ruby?

### Core Concepts & Technologies

- Data in Ruby (integers, floats, strings, arrays, hashes, et-)
- Reading and writing files
- File formats and encoding (text, HTML, CSV, images, et-)
- Command line arguments and environment variables
- Interacting with third-party APIs and websites in Ruby
- Producing web pages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with Ruby

### Projects

- [HTML photo gallery generator][photo-gallery-cli]
- [Text analysis and reporting][text-analysis] (word counts, frequencies, et-)


### Self Contained Coding Problems

- [Series-A Kata][series-A]

## Sprint 2 - First Web Applications

Students will dive into basic database-backed web applications using Sinatra.  This sprint will emphasize wireframes, static mockups, and data modeling.

The high-level goal is to get students comfortable with what it means to write, deploy, and debug a web application.

### Core Concepts & Technologies

- Deploying web applications
- Wireframing, interface design, and static mockups in HTML/CSS
- The HTTP request/response cycle
- Relational databases and persistence
- Modeling data (1-many, many-many)
- Cookies, sessions, and user authentication
- File uploading and processing

### Projects

- [Wall-B, Message Board][wall-b]
- [Command Line Twitter Client][twitter-client]


### Self Contained Coding Problems

- [Series-B Kata][series-B]
- [Series-C Kata][series-C]
- [Sinatra Get Requests][sinatra get requests]
- [Sinatra Post Requests][sinatra post requests]


## Sprint 3 - Core Patterns in Web Development

This sprint will cover several "core patterns" in web development.  Students will have the choice of defining their own project to work on, if they want.

### Core Concepts & Technologies

- AJAX
- File uploading and processing
- Background tasks
- Structured JavaScript
- Sending email
- More complex data models

### Projects

- Maybe a Game TBD...
- [Can I Eat Here][can i eat]
- [Air Stable][air stable]


### Self Contained Coding Problems

- [Series D Kata][series-D]

## Sprint 4 - Capstone Project

Students have the option of defining their own project, continuing to work on their project from Sprint 3, or pick up a new project work on.
