# Sprint 1 - Programming Fundamentals

The first sprint is where we'll be building a base understanding of how programs work. We will focus on building good habits for learning and developing software programs.

### Topics Covered

- Data in Ruby (integers, floats, strings, arrays, hashes, etc.)
- Reading and writing files
- File formats and encoding (text, HTML, CSV, images, etc.)
- Command line arguments and environment variables
- Interacting with third-party APIs and websites in Ruby
- Producing web pages (HTML/CSS/JavaScript) with Ruby
- Git & GitHub
- Using a professional text editor
- Bundler & Gemfiles

### Projects

- [Text Analysis and Reporting][text-analysis]
- [HTML Photo Gallery Generator][photo-gallery-cli]
- [Command-line Twitter Client][twitter-client]

### Exercises

Complete the following exercises (in order) from the [Ruby Exercises][ruby-exercises] repository.

We _do not_ expect students to complete every exercise every week, but you should be attempting as many as you can. **Remember**, the top priority is getting feedback from us, even if your code is incomplete.

1. max.rb
1. min.rb
1. longest_string.rb
1. shortest_string.rb
1. word_count.rb
1. count_in_list.rb
1. count_max.rb
1. sum.rb
1. mean.rb
1. print_square.rb
1. print_triangle.rb
1. print_pyramid.rb
1. print_horizontal_pyramid.rb
1. hot_or_cold.rb

### Examples

[Ruby Examples][ruby-examples]: examples of Ruby programs to solve common tasks.
As we move through the workshop, if there are requests for more examples, we can add them here.

### Guidance

#### What to focus on

The first week serves as a "crash course" in Ruby fundamentals and the overall workflow of our workshop. In order of importance, you should be focusing on:

1. Getting code reviews and feedback from your teachers
1. Getting code reviews and feedback from your teachers
1. Getting code reviews and feedback from your teachers (sensing a pattern?)
1. Developing good habits with the tools you'll be using every day, especially Sublime Text, the command line, and GitHub.
1. Understanding the programming fundamentals via Ruby, particularly
  - **Data and Basic Data Types**
    - Variables and variable assignment
    - Numbers, strings, booleans, `nil`
    - Arrays (`[1,2,3]`), Hashes (`{:name => "Jesse", :age => 30}`)
  - **Essential Program Flow / Control**
    - Branching (`if`, `else`)
    - Looping & iteration (`list.each do |item| ... end`)
    - Defining, calling, and returning from methods (`def my_method(a,b,c) ... end`)

#### What to ignore

You might feel compelled to focus on some or all of the following. Don't!

- Code performance, e.g., "Can I make this faster?"
- Code elegance or cleverness
- What your teachers will "think of you" when they see your code
- How your work will compare to your fellow students'

We know this is easier said than done, so use this list as a check for when you find yourself stalling. Are you hung up because you're worried about one of the above?
