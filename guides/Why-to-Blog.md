### Greetings CodeLings...

There are many instances where Coding Bootcamps tell all the students to blog, blog blog. Some students have a lot of push back on the basis of blogging being a form of free content marketing for the parent company. I cannot lie, this has truth to it. 

CodeUnion would like students to blog for a few key reasons. 

1. We need to see a student's ability to articulate, in natural language, how some technical topics work. I can tell a student to write a sinatra application that accepts standard GET, POST, PUT, DELETE actions. A students has literally cause of google, billions of ways to write that code and it is very possible to write the correct code without a clear understanding of how/why the code is correct and a code review, won't really expose a shaky understanding. On the other hand, a blog post, written in a students own voice, it is very difficult for a student to write clearly about things they don't understand. As your leaders and the people who are clearly bearing the responsibility of getting ya'll up to speed as coders, we can't stress enough how important it is for us to be able to evaluate your understanding of some key topics. 

1. There is a certain component of creativity and maker-ship that we want to draw out in each of your's thinking and actions. Blogging about fluffy high level topics is a great way for you all to be challenged to think and for CodeUnion to better understand each of your internal motivations and goals. As much as coding seems hard and difficult, when you find that creative spark of motivation, everything falls into place. It is our opinion that a little bit of deep thinking and some blogging to articulate that thinking can really facilitate this process. 

Don't worry, we won't ask you to write tons of posts, maybe one a sprint(we'll introduce the idea of a sprint later). You don't have to ever mention anything CodeUnion related in your posts. These posts are for you and for us at CodeUnion to better understand and help you. Of course, we like marketing and good blogging can really help put us on the map. I'm not gonna lie that and say we don't like that but I will very clearly say that we are not asking you to blog because of the need for free marketing. Blogging isn't mandatory either, in fact, nothing is mandatory. Each of you are responsible for your own individual outcomes and mandatory is probably the only word we don't speak. 

Please engage on any of the above if you'd like and have a great Monday,

John
