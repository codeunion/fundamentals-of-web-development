# How to Submit A 'Pull Request'

A 'pull request' is the process of requesting a branch or fork of a currently exisiting repository to be merge back into the original repository.  'Pull Requests' are the lifeblood of distributed collaboration on GitHub, they allow for many people to work on code independently and also for that work to be submitted to a validation process before being integrated into the original work.


### Steps for Completing a Pull Request.

> On GitHub, there are many ways to do things, this is one working example, there may be more.  You the developer are always responsible for how and why you do things the way you do.  

1. Ensure your code is committed and that the <b>remote</b> repository reflects all current <b>local</b> changes.
2. Navigate to the homepage of your branch or fork.
3. Find and click the 'pull request' button.
4. Follow the instructions that GitHub gives you.
