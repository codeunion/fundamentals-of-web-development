# Fundamentals of Web Development

Welcome to CodeUnion's *Fundamentals of Web Development* workshop.  If you're reading this, it means you've decided to take a bit of a risk with us. We appreciate that and promise to reward you with a fun, rewarding, and positive learning experience.

## Your Development Environment

Before you start anything, make sure you have your local development environment up and running correctly by going through our [guide to setting up and verifying your development environment](./Development-Environment.md).

## The Command Line

The **command line** is that scary-seeming, all-text interface you often [see in movies][omg-trinity-hax] and [vintage computer ads][apple-ii-ad]. We've come a long way since then.  After your text editor, most of your development time will be spent on the command line.  In fact, according to [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com), Jesse spent 23% of all his software development time in 2014 there.

To start, you only need to understand a few basic commands.  Here are some resources:

1. Skillcrush's [Command Line Overview][skillcrush-cli]
1. CodeUnion's [Command Line Essentials](./Command-Line-Essentials.md)
1. Treehouse's [Command Line Basics][treehouse-cli-basics]
1. Zed Shaw's [Command Line Crash Course][zed-shaw-cli]

On Mac OS X, you can access the command-line by running [Terminal.app][terminal-app-wiki]. On Windows, you can access it by running [Windows PowerShell][power-shell-wiki].

## Git at CodeUnion

**Important** Please read our [Git Basics guide](./Git-Basics.md), which covers the critical aspects of git and GitHub that we'll be using at CodeUnion.

Git and [GitHub](http://github.com) form the foundation for much of CodeUnion's learning experience, so it's critical you become familiar with GitHub, git, and the common workflows we use to interact with each other. In particular, you should understand what the following phrases mean inside and out:

1. Creating a repository on GitHub
1. Cloning a repository from GitHub
1. Forking a repository on GitHub
1. Commiting code and pushing it to a repository on GitHub

We expect much of the first week to involve getting students comfortable with git and GitHub.  If you're looking for more material, we recommend:
* [Four videos about git](http://git-scm.com/videos) from the creators and maintainers of git
* CodeSchool's *[Try Git][codeschool-try-git]* mini-course

## Expectations

### Students should expect that teachers will...

1. Reply to requests for feedback within *at most* 24 hours
1. Receive *all* feedback from students with gratitude and grace — personal, professional, or otherwise.
1. Give specific, actionable, and encouraging feedback.
1. Actively foster a learning environment that empowers their students.

### We expect that students will...

1. Dedicate a minimum of 20 hours / week coding — and that means hands-on-keyboard coding, not, say, thinking about coding while in the shower.
1. Proactively and regularly seek feedback on their code, no matter how incomplete, inelegant, or unpolished they consider it.
1. Clearly communicate expectations and inform teachers when those expectations aren't being met.
1. Treat their teachers and fellow students with respect and be sensitive to differences in background, life circumstances, and culture.

Consider these expectations binding.  If you, as a student, feel we're not living up to our end of the bargain, you should feel comfortable pointing it out and expect a grateful, gracious, and honest response.

## Weekly Rhythm

The workshop is 8 weeks long and it's critical to establish a consistent weekly rhythm.  These are the key moving parts for every week, each built around giving and receiving different flavors of feedback from teachers and fellow students.

### Projects

The "spinal cord" of the workshop is a collection of weekly projects, starting from basic command-line Ruby applications to proper, hosted-on-a-server web applications.  Even if what the projects do is simple, each one is meant to be "shippable" software.

Early on in the workshop we'll be the one defining and scoping the projects for you.  As the workshop progresses, you'll be working on projects of your own choosing.

Every student should aim to complete *at least* one project per week.  If a project isn't on track, there's probably a problem with the project's scope that should be addressed ASAP!  Ask us for feedback. :)

### [Code Katas][weekly-katas-repo]

We'll also release a new collection of **code katas** each week in the [weekly-katas repository][weekly-katas-repo].  A code kata is a small, self-contained exercise designed to complement the concepts you'll need to work on your projects for that week.  They're named after a common [training technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) found in many Japanese martial arts like karate, judo, and aikido.

Most of our katas are designed be completed in less than an hour by someone with appropriate prior knowledge. Our goal is preparing these katas is not to ensure that you "get them right," but to establish well-calibrated and productive code→feedback→refactor loop.

We *do not* expect students to complete every kata every week, but you should attempt as many as you can. They're also perfect for revisiting later.

### Group Sessions

We have two, **2-hour group sessions** every week.  The schedule is determined by the teachers and students in that workshop based upon their respective availability.

Although there might be lecture-like material in some of these sessions, the main goal is to help students through shared problems and practice skills that are only easily practiced in the presence of a teacher, e.g., learning how your teacher would tackle a problem you've been struggling with.

That means: **come prepared**.
