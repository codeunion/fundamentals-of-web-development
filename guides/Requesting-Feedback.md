# Requesting Feedback on Code

Ahhh, feedback, the lifeblood of CodeUnion's ability make sure everyone progresses.  

Asking for, giving and receiving actionable feedback are all learned skills.  Ask for feedback on small amounts of code, provide context whenever necessary.

1. Familiarize yourself with [request-o-matic][request-o-matic]

1. Use [request-o-matic][request-o-matic] as it was intended
  
  ```shell
  bundle exec ./request-o-matic feedback --url "https://github.com/jcdavison/weekly-katas/commit/2d2a19deb558adc573f9e5ac1e71ecefbb16bcca"
  ```

1. Make sure to request feedback on a specific commit or file

  **The url to a specific commit can be accessed by looking at the commit history on github.**

  Lets say @jcdavison wants a review on a specific commit on his kata.

  1. Head to the repo in question
