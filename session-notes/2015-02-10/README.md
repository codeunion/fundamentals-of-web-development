## A View-First Approach to Design

We're going to build an app that manages backcountry permits. These are the things that you need if you want to go backpacking in the wilderness or in the backcountry of a National Park.

Stages:

1. Define user stories
1. Sketch out UX (user experience) with wireframes
1. Build routes
1. Build views
1. Define the _shape_ of form data
