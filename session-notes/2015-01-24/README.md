# Fundamentals of Web Development

**January 24, 2015**

Addressed a few questions re: how to require files and use methods from required files.

Then jumped in for a group code session on the [HTML Photo Gallery generator project](https://github.com/codeunion/photo-gallery-cli).

Worked through iterations 0.1-0.4. Code from this session can be viewed here: https://github.com/openspectrum/photo-gallery-cli/compare/multi-image-html, although it hasn't been cleaned up much. For a better example implementation, take a look at the code in the [iterations/v0.4](https://github.com/codeunion/photo-gallery-cli/tree/iterations/v0.4) branch of the project.
