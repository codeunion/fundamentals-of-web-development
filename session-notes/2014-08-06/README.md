# Topic of the Day:

### How to make our textalyzer program available to users on the internet?

- [ ] need to have some sinatra code wired up?

- [ ] create a class that is basic stats on a report call it `Tps`, build some `d3` business?

- [ ] need to have a proper twitter api key and some twitter code wired up

Consider the difference in informational utility between knowing the word count stats on the last 100 tweets of a specific hashtag, versus 'influential people', what about instead of counting words, aggregating stats on tweet details, rewtweets/mentions.  what other kind of data might be useful that isn't already available?  What is the ui for the data, ui for getting access to the program?

# Food for thought, aka, Eat my words..

### How is a web framework more of a User Interface and scalabilty tool that a program itself?

### What is the actual program and where does the program do its major work?

### What it the role of a token in authenticating a web request? re twitter calls

#### What is the intellectual equivalent of a foodie?
