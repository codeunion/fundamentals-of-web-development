## Objects

Technical definition of objects: **encapsulate behavior and state**.

- We've already been using objects
- Explore built-in objects
- Define some new objects
- A brief history: the struct

## Object-Oriented Programming

An approach to programming that prioritizes objects and object relationships. Useful in modeling systems with clearly identifiable units.

In contrast to other paradigms: procedural, declarative, functional.

Define a system and model it in an OOP way. Example: a postal service. Or a wildlife preserve.

- Tell a story
- Identify the players and actions
- Define the objects, data, and behavior
